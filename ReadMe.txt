Overview:
This project is a strategy game where players control units on a grid-based map. The game features both a Console Mode (CLI) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using JavaFX.

Key Features:
- Players can choose units, buy, move, and attack.
- Save and load game states, including terrain and player information.
- The game progresses through turns, and the current player alternates after each turn.
- The GUI provides an interactive experience, while the CLI offers a text-based alternative.

Running the Program

1. CLI Mode
You can run the game in Console Mode by passing the -cli argument when running the main class.

Steps:
1. Compile and build the project.
2. Run the program with the -cli argument.

java -jar strategy_game.jar -cli

This will start the game in Console Mode, where you can interact with the game using text-based input and output.

2. GUI Mode (JavaFX)
If you don't pass the -cli argument, the program will start in Graphical User Interface (GUI) Mode. This mode is built using JavaFX, providing a visual map, unit selection, and interactive gameplay.

Steps to Run the GUI Mode:
1. Ensure you have JavaFX set up on your system.
2. Compile and build the project.
3. Run the program without any arguments.

Requirements:
- Java 8 or higher: The program is built with Java and requires at least JDK 8 for both the CLI and GUI versions.
- JavaFX: For GUI Mode, you need JavaFX libraries. Ensure that JavaFX is properly installed and configured in your project.
  - If you are using Java 11 or higher, you may need to include JavaFX separately. You can download it from JavaFX Downloads (https://openjfx.io/).

Save and Load Functionality
The game includes a save/load feature, allowing you to save the game state and resume later. The saved data includes the game map, units, player resources, and the current player.

- To save the game, use the in-game options (either through the CLI or GUI).
- To load a saved game, use the load option in the menu or use the corresponding command in the CLI.

Known Issues:
- JavaFX setup may require additional configuration for certain environments (e.g., Java 11+).
- Game logic may not be fully optimized in the current version.
